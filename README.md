# Minikernel - Advanced Operating Systems
Source code of the practical assignment Minikernel. @UPM

## Objectives

The objective of this practice is for the student to become familiar with the main concepts related to process management and multiprogramming. To do this, the student will have to write the "operating system code" that performs process management. Obviously, due to complexity reasons, this is not code that will execute on real hardware, but rather it is worked on in an emulated environment called minikernel, which provides a virtual hardware on which to develop the operating system. Despite this, during the development of the practice, the student will encounter a working mode and a problem similar to that presented when working on "real" operating system code.

## Main topics

The startup of the operating system.
The management of interrupts.
The management of exceptions.
The management of system calls.
Multiprogramming.
Context switching.
Process scheduling.
Synchronization between processes.
Input/output handlers.
